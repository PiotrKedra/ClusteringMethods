# Implementation of clustering ML methods

Here you can find our implementations of several clustering methods. We made them for university project.

## How to run (windows)

first install required packages

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
Each method is in separate folder (our implementation and sklearn usage).
Single and hierarchical methods have same base codes since they are very similar.

run by command

    python main.py
